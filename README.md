# Boggle

[Play it here!](https://bogle.netlify.app)

## What

A fun way to play the game of [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) alone or with friends. Mobile-friendly UI supports touch select for dice, but also allows for keyboard dice selection for desktop users. Dark mode & light mode support based on user's device preferences. Supports multiplayer games using websockets.

## Why

There are plenty of Boggle players out there, but I couldn't find one that was easy to set up a simple game to play remotely with friends. Boggle also presents a few fun algorithm problems to solve such as finding all possible answers for a given board. Adding keyboard support and checking the board for valid paths based on any given combination of keypresses also presented a nice challenge.
